This unit introduces you to the concept of using loops in code.

They might look a bit scary but you'll get the hang of them very quickly.

### A for loop
```python
total = 0

for x in range(0, 10):
  total = total + x
  print total
```

### A while loop
```python
counter = 0

while counter <= 9:
  print counter
  counter = counter + 1
```

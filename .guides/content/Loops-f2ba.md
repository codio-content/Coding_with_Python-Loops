This Unit introduces you to the concept of loops using code.

They may look a little scary but you'll get the hang of them very quickly.

### A for loop
```python
total = 0

for x in range(0, 10):
  total = total + x
  print total
```

### A while loop
```python
counter = 0

while counter <= 9:
  print counter
  counter = counter + 1
```

In the end of loop statements you can see we have `ctr++`. 

- `ctr++` is shorthand for `ctr = ctr + 1`. 
- `ctr--` is shorthand for `ctr = ctr - 1`. 

You will very often see this as it saves space and is also nice and clear what it is doing.

## var+= and var-=
For those interested, there is another really nice shorthand solution.

- `ctr += 10` is shorthand for `ctr = ctr + 10`
- `ctr -= 10` is shorthand for `ctr = ctr - 10`
- `ctr *= 10` is shorthand for `ctr = ctr * 10`
- `ctr /= 10` is shorthand for `ctr = ctr / 10`

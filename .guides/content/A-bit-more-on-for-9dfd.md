In the code on the left, you can see that we have moved things around even more.

We have put the `output(total)` into the end of loop stataments. 

{Run the code}(node run-user.js 3-loops/for2.js)

## So why is for better than while?
There are a couple of reasons why `for` is better than `while` and why you should almost always use it in preference to `while`.

1. It puts all of the loop initialization and variable logic into the `for` statement itself, which makes it easier to understand how the loop is being controlled.
1. It leaves the loop's code block free of all that stuff so it can focus on what's going on inside the loop.
1. Once you have see `for` statements a few times, the loop as a whole is easier to read.

Feel free to hack the code around on the left. If you mess it up, reset it by the 'Reset Chapter' option in the Settings menu at the top of this page.

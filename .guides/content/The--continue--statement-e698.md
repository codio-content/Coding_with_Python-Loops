The `continue` statement can also be useful on occasions. 

It simply jumps to the end of the loop so execution can continue onwards from the start of the loop. The end of loop conditions (`i++` in this case) will be executed before the loop execution recommences.

The example on the left shows a loop that skips displaying the loop counter if it is an odd number.

The `continue` statement is used to jump over one iteration and continue the loop from the top.

The example on the left shows a loop that skips displaying the loop counter if it is an odd number.

Like `break` on the previous page, `continue` should not be necessary under any normal circumstances. Any code that seems to require a continue statement could be rewritten better without it.

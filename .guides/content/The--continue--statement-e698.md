Where the `break` statement jumps out of a loop or block, the `continue` statement jumps over one iteration, continuing the loop from the top.  

The example on the left shows a loop that skips displaying the loop counter if it is an odd number.

Like `break`, `continue` should not be necessary under any normal circumstances. Any code that seems to require a continue statement can be rewritten better without it.

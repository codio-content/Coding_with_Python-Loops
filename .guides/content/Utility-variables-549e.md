Utility variables have been covered before in the Flode units. If you have worked through those units, hopefully you will remember a little bit about utility variables.

## Recap
Very often in a loop, you will need to update a value with each *iteration* of your loop. At the end of the loop you might want to do something with that value.

On the left is a good example of this shown in a Flode chart. The Flode chart is doing the following:

> Add up all the value between 0 and 10 and output the result.

Step through the chart and carefully watch the variable called `total`. You can see that the `total` variable is updated each time we pass through the loop. Once the loop is finished, we output the `total` that has been increasing with each *iteration* of the loop.

A number of the challenges that follow require you to use this technique, so make sure that you understand it.

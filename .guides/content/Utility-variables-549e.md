Hopefully you'll remember our discussion on utiity variables from the earlier Flode Units.

## Recap
Very often in a loop, you will need to update a value with each *iteration* of your loop. At the end of the loop you may want to do something with that value.

On the left is a good example of this. This Flode chart is doing the following.

> Add up all the value between 0 and 10 and output the result.

Now step through the chart and keep a close eye on the variable called `total`. You can see that this variable is updated each time we pass through the loop. Once the loop is finished, we output `total` that has been growing and growing with each *iteration* of the loop.

Several of the following challenges require this technique, so make sure you understand it.
